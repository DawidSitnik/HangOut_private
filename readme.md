## 1. Project hangOut  
As our capstone design project we decided to create a mobile application (frontend) and a server (backend). The project is called hangOut. Purpose of the application is to make creating spontaneous meetings easier for people. Users will be required to register and set their profiles. Profile will consist of photos and description which willl be stored on server. Then they will be able to select what they will want to do (e.g. smoke a cigarette with someone else or have a coffee). They can also search for people who want to meet in their area, chat, create groups, display location of others on a map. Server will also use a no-SQL database to store information about users.
All information about project, presentations and project itself will be stored on our github page which is: https://github.com/grypesc/hangOut

## 2. Tools  
* https://github.com/grypesc/hangOut – project’s repository  
* Ubuntu 18, Android – Operating systems used for development  
* Javascript – Programming language for both frontend and backend  
* Atom – Text editor  
* npm – Package mangaer  
* git – Version control system  
* Babel.js – Javascript compiler  
* Postman – Testing and debugging the server  
* LibreOffice – Office suite used to create documents and presentations  
#### Frontend: ####  
* React Native – frontend's framework  
* Expo – frontend's development enviroment  
* Android Studio – Android emulation  
* Gimp – Raster graphics editor  
#### Backend: ####  
* Node.js – server's environment  
* Express.js – server's framework  
* MongoDB – open source database  

## 3. Why and what for?  
Technology we chose allows to simultaneously develop a project for both IOS and Android systems. We think Javascript React Native will be a top smartphone programming technology
in the future therefore we decided to learn it. What’s more we abandonded the idea of using Firebase database and decided to write our own server to make the project more complex and learn backend implementation. Database we chose is also one of the most famous no-SQL databases so it is worh to learn it. Project itself is very serious and will be a good addition to our portfolio. Please note that all the tools and technologies are open source what will allow us to publish the application in Google Play store and Apple’s App Store.
